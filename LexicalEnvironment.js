/*
  Think of Scope as a magical boundary that defines where you can access variables or functions in your code. 
  It‚Äôs like knowing which room in a house contains the cookie jar (a very important skill üç™). 
  If you‚Äôre inside the room, you can grab cookies (variables); if not, sorry, no cookies for you.

Types of Scope in JavaScript:
Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function live here. They‚Äôre like celebrities ‚Äî everyone knows them!

Local Scope: Variables declared inside a function live here. They‚Äôre shy and can only be accessed inside their own function.

Block Scope: Variables declared with let or const inside a block {} live here. They‚Äôre introverts and don‚Äôt like stepping out.
